# GTO Wizard AI Researcher API Client
Despite the growing interest in applying generalist AI agents and LLMs to games, a standardized platform for benchmarking their performance in poker has been lacking. We introduce GTO Wizard Research API: a public API that provides a standardized environment for benchmarking AI agents in No-Limit Texas Hold'em, the most popular variant of poker.

This API enables researchers to test their agents against [GTO Wizard AI](https://blog.gtowizard.com/introducing-gto-wizard-ai/), a proprietary state-of-the-art poker agent that demonstrated superior performance against [Slumbot](https://slumbot.com/), the past winner of the Annual Computer Poker Competition. Our system evaluates agents using [AIVAT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.06915), a provably unbiased low-variance technique for evaluating performance in imperfect information games, reducing the standard deviation by almost 10x in practice. We make the evaluation results publicly available through a free website and a real-time leaderboard.

## Documentation
To dive deeper on how to benchmark your agent against GTO Wizard AI, check out the [API documentation](https://researcher.gtowizard.com/docs).

## Obtaining an API key
Access to the Research API is currently gated. To obtain an API Key, please email **benchmark [at] gtowizard [dot] com** with the following information:

1.  Your Name / Organization
2.  A brief description of your research and the intended use case for the benchmark.

## Installation
**Prerequisites:**
- Python 3.13+
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager

**Setup:**
```bash
# Install dependencies
uv sync
```

## Usage

This repository provides skeleton agents to benchmark against GTO Wizard AI:
- **allin**: Always goes all-in when possible, otherwise calls
- **checkcall**: Always checks when possible, otherwise calls

**Run an agent:**
```bash
cd src && uv run python -m main --api-key YOUR_API_KEY --agent allin --num-hands 10
```
### Developing your own agent
To create a custom agent, simply add a new class in `src/poker_agent.py` that implements the `PokerAgent` protocol.
